## Introduction ##

The **LDSpider** project provides a web crawling framework for the Linked Data web.

Requirements and challenges for crawling the Linked Data web are different from regular web crawling, thus the LDSpider project offers a web crawler adapted to traverse and harvest content from the Linked Data web.

Due to [Google's change to Google code](http://google-opensource.blogspot.de/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html), the downloads page cannot be maintained any more, so you have to browse the repository for both code and jars. Note that you can use maven with the google code repository. The groupId is `com.ontologycentral` and the artifactId `ldspider`.

The project is a co-operation between [Andreas Harth](http://harth.org/andreas/) at [AIFB](http://www.aifb.kit.edu/) and [Juergen Umbrich](http://umbrich.net) at [DERI](http://www.deri.ie/). [Aidan Hogan](http://sw.deri.org/~aidanh/), Tobias Kaefer and [Robert Isele](http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/en/institute/pwo/bizer/team/IseleRobert.html) are contributing.

## Features ##
  * **Content Handlers for different formats**:
    * Includes handlers to read RDF/XML, N-TRIPLES and N-QUADS;
    * [Any23](http://any23.apache.org/) handlers for other RDF serialisations, e.g. RDFa
    * Simple interface design to implement own handlers (e.g. to handle additional formats).
  * **Different crawling strategies**
    * Breadth-first crawl;
    * Depth-first crawl;
    * optionally crawl schema information (TBox).
  * **Crawling scope**
    * crawl can easily be restricted to specific pages e.g. pages with a specific domain prefix.
  * **Output formats** - The crawled data can be written in various ways:
    * The output can be written to files in different formats, such as RDF/XML or N-QUADS
    * The crawler can write all statements to a Triple Store using SPARQL/Update. Optionally uses named graphs to structure the written statements by their source page.
    * Optionally, the output include provenance information.

### Getting Started ###
**LDSpider** can be used in two ways:
  * Through a command line application. [Getting started (CLI)](https://github.com/ldspider/ldspider/wiki/GettingStartedCommandLine)
  * Through a flexible API, which provides various [Hooks](https://github.com/ldspider/ldspider/wiki/Hooks) to extend the behavior of the crawler. [Getting started (API)](https://github.com/ldspider/ldspider/wiki/GettingStartedAPI)
